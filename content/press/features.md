Classic side-scrolling action with overhauled functionality.

Ultra crisp gameplay focusing on combat. Blast, Sprint, Dodge, Reload, and create space through elemental grenades to take down the most sinister of foes.

Explore an island decimated by death. You will venture through many diverse and luscious biomes that once prospered, not long ago.

The road less traveled, Ko'Verest island is very large. Go in any direction, choose which creatures to fight, and what biomes to explore.

Upgrade your arsenal. Upgrade damage, firing rates, magazine capacity, reload speed, and ascend each weapon beyond normal means to unlock special perks that may tilt a fight in your direction.

Equip and upgrade grenades! The latest advancements in grenade technologies allow for space creating maneuvers even when your back is against a wall.

Minimal UI elements submerging the player even further into the madness.

Devastating enemies drawn in ultra high resolution. Masterfully animated to deliver breathtaking results.

Advanced enemy AI enabling devastating combat moments with even the most basic of enemies.

Resource collection, gather regents from the environment for use in creating potions and strengthening your healing flask.

Gorgeous hand drawn worlds with beautiful parallax, which gives this 2D world even more depth.

Chart your adventure with mapping tools. Lay colorized pins to aid your understanding of Ko'Verests many landscapes.

A top notch musical score composed by the talented Andrew De Lange. The score resonates the lethality and terror of the haunting events that took place on Ko'Verest Island.

Defeating Creatures Of War enables two new modes. Again + a more difficult version of the original game with all of your gear from the previous playthrough equipped on the player as well as Survivor mode where you have one life to live and death is permanent.
