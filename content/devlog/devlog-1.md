Creatures Of War has been announced! When developing this game I wanted to focus on tightly controlled tense combat situations requiring precise dodge mechanics, speed burst / grenade usage optimizations for creating space, and of course high powered weaponry that can bring down even the toughest of enemies.

When I thought to myself about creating a 2D combat system I knew that the gameplay was the most important aspect of the game’s development process. I have spared no expense here. I am making sure that enemies are fast, agile, and intelligent. Focusing too long on one enemy and not enough on another will result in a swift death. I want people to die over and over due to lack of tactical understanding, not to a singular attack that hits way too hard. After playing through the game for a few hours and slowly introducing new combat elements strategically, I am hoping that people will master the combat loop by splitting up hordes of enemies, creating space, aiming, choosing which weapons are better for killing certain creatures, and simply knowing when you are outmatched, yes retreating is sometimes the best move.

As of this writing the player has a boatload of weapons to choose from. The weapons are labeled and will be carried on the player in this manner. Pistol, Heavy Weapon Left, Heavy Weapon Right, and Revolver. Grenade slots will eventually populate the player as the game progresses. These weapons will all have advantages and disadvantages. The focus with the weaponry put into the game is that I want every choice you make to be impactful. Upgrading a weapon early will make the short term goals easily achievable. Later on you will have less resources to spend on weapon purchases or weapon upgrades, your choices matter.

Enemies will have certain traits associated with them. For example one enemy may have armored skin that has an exposed weak spot. The skin may reduce damage taken by 80% while the exposed area will take 100% of your weapon damage or potentially 120%. Tactically choosing a weapon that deals high amounts of damage but also has good aim is crucial against such a foe. I want people to recognize the different enemy subtypes and approach them differently. If you attempt to beat the game without swapping weapons, it will be possible, but you will be missing a major chunk of the ebb and flow of the game.

AND…. that is all for now, I wanted to give everyone some insight into what is most important to me, the gameplay, combat loop, and upgrade / purchasing system.

P.S. I truly love video games and I made sure that all of my contractors love video games as much as I do. The art work, sfx’s, and musical score are all topics of the future that I am very excited to share with you.

Tata everyone,

Tim from Chaos Entertainment
